# STOMP - Obsidian Foot Pedal Plugin

A simple Obsidian plugin that enables hands-free reading using foot pedals. STOMP intercepts PageUp and PageDown key events to provide smooth, customizable scrolling through your notes. I initially wrote this to integrate with my [Coda STOMP](https://www.codamusictech.com/) (hence the name), but it should work with any pedal.

## Purpose

Some uses for this plugin include:

- Using Obsidian for [chord sheets](https://github.com/jheddings/obsidian-chopro)
- Taking notes while reading books or papers
- Keeping hands free for other tasks while reviewing content
- Using accessibility devices that map to system keys

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Animated page scrolling instead of jarring jumps
- **Wide-Range Support**: Configurable key bindings used by many pedals
- **Customizable Experience**: Adjustable scroll speed and distance
- **Command Palette**: Scroll commands available via Obsidian's command palette

## Configuration

Access settings through **Settings → Community Plugins → STOMP**.

## Installation

Installation is supporting using BRAT.

## Known Issues

- On some mobile devices, the Page Up / Down keys are not properly captured and may not trigger the plugin.
